# People

Many people interact with Evernym's verity, either directly or indirectly.
Our design should make good/desirable behaviors with
respect to the verity easy, questionable behaviors hard, and wrong
behaviors impossible.

## Important Roles

* Evernym <font color="red">Ops staff (sysadmins)</font>. (Do these people
  have access to all systems equally,
   or do we need to differentiate between a backup admin, LDAP admin,
   etc)?
* Evernym <font color="red">NOC staff</font>. These may be less privileged
  and less deeply trained technicians than normal Ops staff, but they
  monitor status carefully and escalate to Ops as needed.
* Evernym <font color="red">Support</font>. Will there be multiple levels
  of support staff, and will that imply different privileges?
* <font color="red">Evernym developers and QA experts</font>
* <font color="red">Evernym business people who want to demo/sell</font>
* Evernym customers that are <font color="red">institutions</font>:
  * <font color="red">Developers who work for the institution</font> and develop software that
    calls verity APIs. These developers may use Evernym's Enterprise Verity UI
    to develop schemas and credential defintions.
  * <font color="red">Institutional employees</font> who consume verity features via packaged software written
    by mainly by developers working for the institution. These people
    probably have to interface with in-house databases and tools, and
    probably spend most of their time on issuance and related business
    processes.
  * <font color="red">Decision-makers</font> (e.g., CIO, GMs, CISOs) who will see demos and
    possibly evaluate. Also, the people who pay bills authorized by
    these decision-makers.
* Evernym customers that are <font color="red">end-users of Connect.Me</font>.
