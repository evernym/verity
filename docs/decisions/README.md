## Architectural Decisions
This is the definitive repository for global Architectural Decisions (ADs) for this code base. All such decisions **shall be** recorded as Architectural Design Records (ADRs) and approved by the Platform Guild.
### Instructions
To propose a new Verity AD, the process is as follows:
1. Create a branch following the following scheme: `[firstname].[lastname]_yymmdd_adr-[title-of-adr-wiith-dashes]`.
2. Copy the ADR template and fill in all required information. The file name shall be `NNNN-title-of-adr-with-dashes` with `NNNN` being the next available consecutive number between `0001` and `9999` currently not assigned to an ADR.
3. Submit an MR against `main` with any needed explanation included as comments. Review and approve the MR at a guild meeting or over slack.
