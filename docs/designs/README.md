## Designs
The folder contains documentation for designs (feature, refactoring, etc.) that will be built into verity. 

They could include:
* **POA (Plan of Attack)**: A concise set of collateral that documents the expected implementation approach for a unit of work (normally an epic in Jira). POA are intended to be review by other members of the guild to increase alignment and improve the planned approach. The form and level of detail is deliberately left vague to allow flexibility depending on the level and scope of the work being planned. But the creator and reviewers should leave feeling that they understand what will be done.
* **Formal Design Docs**: A more complete and form record of a design for Verity. Should have a more considered and complete description of the design considered. These designs would normally span more than a single epic ticket (a unit of customer value).  

Documents container here DO NOT replace:
* ADR for architectural decisions
  * If an architectural consideration is needed, an ADR is required 
* Proper documentation that should be contained in [documentation folder](../documentation/README.md)
